# GZHU_DCASE2023_TASK1
This code base was used for the GZHU team's submission to DCASE2023 Task I Low Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification. The technical report corresponding to it can be found in [DCASE2023](https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-low-complexity-acoustic-scene-classification).\\
The entire code framework was written based on [PANNs](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn) and the pre-trained model we used, resnet38, can be downloaded in [there](https://zenodo.org/record/3987831).
